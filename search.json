Let’s give it a quick shot:\n\n?str\n\nAs you read that documentation, you’ll notice it says that str is a common alternative to summary. Maybe we should give that a try, too.\n\nsummary(stout_data)\n\nBut wait, there’s more. What if I want to ask R to summarize not the entire stout dataset, but just teh willingness to pay data? Well, that’s going to look something like this:\n\nsummary(stout_data$WTP)\n\nWhat we’re doing in that command is once again orienting R with exactly where we want it to look. The statement says “Hey, R, go ahead and do summary on this thing that exists in the dataset I have loaded named stout_data. Once you get in stout_data, you’re going to want to look for the variable named WTP. Use that and only that.”\nSo same info as before, but a way to be more specific in asking R to focus on what I specifically want more information about as opposed to just summarizing everything."

We’ll call that value in our dataset Error_Brewmaster:\n\nstout_data$Error_Brewmaster &lt;- stout_data$WTP - stout_data$Model_Brewmaster\n\nWhat this line of code is saying to R is: “R, I want you to go to that dataset I have loaded called stout_data and when you get there, create a NEW variable that you’re going to call Error_Brewmaster. The way that you will create Error_Brewmaster will be to subtract the value associated with the existing variable Model_Brewmaster from the value associated with the existing variable WTP for each observation in the dataset.”\n…And because I’m compulsive, I’m going to check again to make sure it did exactly that:\n\nhead(stout_data)"

We’re telling R to create another new variable in the existing dataset (stout_data) and to call that new variable Model_Like_Stout. We then have to tell R how to fill in that column and this time, there are two different options. The statement we make there is saying IF the response on that row to the existing LikesStout item is “Yes”, then R should put the value we calculate for the mean of the yes respondents for that new variable.

But what do people actually mean when they say they want to be happy?\nWith Lawrence Williams, I study the distinction between happiness as pleasure (hedonic well-being) and happiness as meaning (eudaimonic well-being). We find that consumers approach these differently: compared to pursuing pleasure, pursuing meaning involves expectations of lasting benefits—and requires greater minimum time investments to derive those benefits.\nThis has implications for how we design experiences, how we market them, and how consumers allocate their most precious resource: time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSelected Publications\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers’ Minimum Time Investments in Meaningful Consumption Percival Carter, Williams, & Light • Marketing Letters, 2023 Read →"

A blemished apple might be more appealing than a perfect one—because the blemish reduces uncertainty about how it was grown.\nThis work has implications for artisan producers, sustainable agriculture, and anyone competing on authenticity rather than polish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWorking Paper\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pursuit of Imperfection: Flawed Products Reduce Process Uncertainty Percival Carter & McGraw • Preparing for submission\nAs discussed on the Here We Are podcast and demonstrated memorably by Ron Swanson."

You just need to know where things are stored so you can find them later.\nThat said, I’d recommend a nice, safe, boring file structure. Inside your main folder, create subfolders like:\nMarketing_Research_R_Fall2025/\n├── Code/\n├── Datasets/\n├── Homework/\n└── Resources/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarningAvoid these locations\n\n\n\nDo NOT work from your Downloads folder.
