# 404

## This page has wandered off.

Probably into the pasture. Possibly into a dataset that didn't save correctly.

Either way, it's not here.

**You could try:**

- Going [back home](index.qmd) and starting over
- Checking if you typed the URL correctly (R is case-sensitive; turns out, so are URLs)
- Accepting that sometimes things just don't work and that's okay

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
If you think this page *should* exist and I've broken something, I'd genuinely appreciate a heads up at [erin.p.carter@maine.edu](mailto:erin.p.carter@maine.edu). 

No one's in trouble. I just want to fix it.
