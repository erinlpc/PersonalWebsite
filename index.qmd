I'm an Associate Professor of Marketing at the University of Maine,
where I use experiments and data to understand consumer judgment and
decision-making.

My research focuses on questions at the intersection of **consumer behavior**
and **moral judgment and decision making**: How do people pursue meaning versus pleasure? When do
prices feel unfair? Why might a *flawed* product be more appealing than
a perfect one?

I'm also a co-founder of the [BARD Institute](bard.qmd), working to
bring rigorous business thinking to sustainable agriculture in Maine.

Current Focus
:::

## Navigating Risk in Food Systems

I'm currently investigating how Maine can communicate about PFAS
contamination in ways that inform consumers without unfairly damaging
perceptions of all Maine-grown food. This work sits at the intersection
of risk perception, regional branding, and the psychology of trust.

I'm also developing new courses on the **psychology of time management**
and **moral judgment in business**—topics I wish someone had taught me
earlier in my career.
