## Interactive Tools

These Shiny applications help you explore statistical concepts visually. Play with them to build intuition before diving into the math.

1. [Bagel Run Predictor](shinyapps/BagelRunPredictor.qmd) — Our first attempts at some basic model comparisons...but make it about bagels...

2. [Central Tendency & CLT Explorer](shinyapps/CentralTendencyVisualizer.qmd) — Visualizing samples, distributions, measures of central tendency, and Z scores

3. [Simple Models and F Stats](shinyapps/SimpleModelsFStats.qmd) — This week we are beginning to do some very simple model comparisons and start working with new model comparison statistics

4. [Simple Models and F Stats](shinyapps/SimpleRegressionIntuitionBuilder.qmd) — We're officially working with model comparisons of mean only versus simple regression models!

Example structure:
### Sampling & Distributions
- [Central Limit Theorem Explorer](https://your-account.shinyapps.io/clt/) — Watch sampling distributions emerge
- [Confidence Interval Simulator](https://your-account.shinyapps.io/ci/) — Understand what 95% confidence really means

### Regression
- [Simple Regression Visualizer](https://your-account.shinyapps.io/regression/) — See how data points influence the line

## Coding Assignments

These assignments build your R skills progressively. Each is designed to be accessible—you don't need prior programming experience.

### Getting Started

1. [Week 1: File Management Practice](assignments/hw1-file-management.qmd) — Install R/RStudio, set up your folders, learn relative paths

2. [Week 2: Stout Exercise](assignments/stout_exercise.qmd) — Practice loading data, intro to model comparison

3. [Week 3: Coffee Errors Exercise](assignments/ch2-coffee-errors-exercise.qmd) — In this exercise you will calculate A LOT (sorry but it's important for building understanding long term) of different types of error 

4. [Week 3: Stout Festival Exercise](assignments/stout-festival-exercise.qmd) — New data from our week 2 client! Now we'll play with different measures of central tendency and error

5. [Week 4: Examining Spread and Standardization](assignments/week4-exercise.qmd) — In this exercise we examine why and how to examine the spread or variability of our data. We also have some fun (maybe?) with Z scores

6. [Week 5: PRE, Critical Values, and F Tests](assignments/week5-exercise.qmd) — In this exercise we start really working on some more substantial model comparisons and the PRE, critical value, and F Test conversations that allows follow

7. [Week 6: Power, Sensitivity, SESOI, Effect Size, CIs, and OPTIONAL Intro to Bootstrapping](assignments/week6-exercise.qmd) — This week we examine different ways of measuring how sure we are of an effect - that we'll find it, that it is "big enough" to matter, and how to talk about these concerns with statistics or otherwise

**More coming** · Additional assignments will be added throughout the semester.

## Resources

### Setup

Before the first assignment, you'll need:

1. **R** — [Download from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. **RStudio** — [Download from Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

I'll walk through installation in class, but these links have everything you need.

### References

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) — Free online textbook; excellent for beginners
