## Interactive Tools

These Shiny applications help you explore statistical concepts visually. Play with them to build intuition before diving into the math.

1. [Week 2: Bagel Run Predictor](shinyapps/BagelRunPredictor.qmd) — Our first attempts at some basic model comparisons...but make it about bagels...

1. [Week 4: Central Tendency & CLT Explorer](shinyapps/CentralTendencyVisualizer.qmd) — Visualizing samples, distributions, measures of central tendency, and Z scores

**More Coming Soon** · Links to Shiny apps will be added as they're migrated to the new site.

Example structure:
### Sampling & Distributions
- [Central Limit Theorem Explorer](https://your-account.shinyapps.io/clt/) — Watch sampling distributions emerge
- [Confidence Interval Simulator](https://your-account.shinyapps.io/ci/) — Understand what 95% confidence really means

### Regression
- [Simple Regression Visualizer](https://your-account.shinyapps.io/regression/) — See how data points influence the line

## Coding Assignments

These assignments build your R skills progressively. Each is designed to be accessible—you don't need prior programming experience.

### Getting Started

1. [Week 1: File Management Practice](assignments/hw1-file-management.qmd) — Install R/RStudio, set up your folders, learn relative paths

2. [Week 2: Stout Exercise](assignments/stout_exercise.qmd) — Practice loading data, intro to model comparison

3. [Week 3: Coffee Errors Exercise](assignments/ch2-coffee-errors-exercise.qmd) — In this exercise you will calculate A LOT (sorry but it's important for building understanding long term) of different types of error 

4. [Week 3: Stout Festival Exercise](assignments/stout-festival-exercise.qmd) — New data from our week 2 client! Now we'll play with different measures of central tendency and error

4. [Week 4: Examining Spread and Standardization](assignments/week4-exercise.qmd) — In this exercise we examine why and how to examine the spread or variability of our data. We also have some fun (maybe?) with Z scores

## Resources

### Setup

Before the first assignment, you'll need:

1. **R** — [Download from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. **RStudio** — [Download from Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

I'll walk through installation in class, but these links have everything you need.

### Getting Help

Stuck on an assignment? In order:

1. Re-read the error message carefully
2. Google the error message (seriously—this is what professionals do)
3. Check the course discussion board
4. Come to office hours
