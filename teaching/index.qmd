I teach courses that help students understand how consumers think, how to build relationships that drive sales, and how to use data to make better marketing decisions. I also develop professional skills courses on topics I wish someone had taught me earlier.

## Special Topics

I've also developed experiential courses connecting business students with sustainable agriculture in Maine, in partnership with the [BARD Institute](../bard.qmd) and organizations including Maine Farmland Trust, the Maine Cheese Guild, and Maine Fibershed. These courses—funded in part by a [congressional earmark](https://umaine.edu/news/blog/2022/09/16/mbs-percival-carter-welcomer-awarded-292k-small-business-administration-grant-for-bard-program/)—give students hands-on experience applying business skills in contexts they rarely encounter in traditional coursework.
