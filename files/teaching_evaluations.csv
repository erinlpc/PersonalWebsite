Spring 2018,374,001,Personal Selling & Sales Management,in-person,signed,general,"Originally did not plan to take this course because I didn’t think I had an interest in sales, but I needed an elective and this was the only one offered. After the first few weeks I gained interest in the class and realized how much sales goes hand in hand w/ marketing. On top of that Erin Carter is an amazing professor and I wish I was able to take more classes taught by her.",
Spring 2018,374,001,Personal Selling & Sales Management,in-person,signed,general,I took this class because I needed it for my minor but also because Erin was teaching it. I tokk a class with her last semester and loved the way she taught. All of her slides and lessons are relevant to today’s workplaces.

Spring 2018,378,001,Marketing Research,in-person,signed,general,"It would be helpful for studying if the slides were more informative & easier to follow. Overall, I enjoyed my time in your class.",
Spring 2018,378,001,Marketing Research,in-person,signed,general,I think you are cool! But many students felt confused over the material. Maybe providing a book will reinforce the material that needs to be learned with concrete examples. If not maybe adding videos would help. Overall I did learn some but didn’t feel like I learned a lot.,
Spring 2018,378,001,Marketing Research,in-person,signed,general,Exams were extremely hard and I studied so much for all of the exams and didn’t do well. A textbook or better slides would definitely benefit this class because I feel like some information is lacking.,
Spring 2018,378,001,Marketing Research,in-person,signed,general,I felt this semester was challenging and I would like to think it was the class set up. I’ve never had a class in a computer lab and felt the tv’s weren’t useful for everyone and feel it could’ve been a better learning environment in an open class for more of a community gathering like the consumer behavior lecture room.,

Fall 2018,378,002,Marketing Research,in-person,signed,general,"Adapted the course well after circumstances, I almost wish she had given us a whole new syllabus for her half of the course, but I understand why, and it likely saved the class from some radical shifts in difficulty and content. Great professor, I wish I could take a full class with her.",Took over teaching course mid-semester
Fall 2018,378,003,Marketing Research,in-person,signed,general,I was not expecting to have Erin Carter as a professor for this course. She handled the challenge of teaching a course mid-semester extremely well. I appreciate her thoroughness and her ability to communicate all updates and changes to the course.,Took over teaching course mid-semester

The hackathons she created for this course were, in my opinion, a much more effective way to test students’ knowledge and application of the things they’re learning, at least in this context.

She makes her online class particularly flexible to accommodate the busy lives of her students, who are likely taking the online course because of their lifestyle. Her assignments have a clear purpose and don't feel like busy work. Erin's ""hackathon"" model is a vast improvement over typical exams. I think that having students work in teams to solve an actual problem is a far better testament to the skills they've learned about in class than having them remember them for an exam.

Fall 2023,382,0190,Consumer Behavior,online,signed,most_value,"I found significant value in the comprehensive framework provided for understanding the intricacies of consumer behavior. The exploration of psychological, situational, technological, social, and cultural factors influencing the entire consumption process, from pre–purchase to post–purchase stages, offered a holistic perspective. Specific topics such as perception, motivation, attitudes, values, and the consumer decision–making process were particularly enlightening, providing valuable insights into the drivers behind consumer choices.",

Fall 2023,382,0190,Consumer Behavior,online,signed,most_value,"I really enjoyed the video lectures. They did a great job conveying the key aspects of the content in an engaging way. Similarly, the emphasis on keeping theories ""Predictable and Parsimonious"" was SO helpful! Oftentimes, scholars try to make theories so complex, and using the two p's to pare down theories really helps!",

Fall 2023,382,0190,Consumer Behavior,online,signed,additional_topics,"I mean, the assignments and quizzes accurately reflected the coursework each week. We were provided more than enough information and tools to find solutions so I can't imagine any changes that need to be made.",
Fall 2023,382,0190,Consumer Behavior,online,signed,additional_topics,"I would find it valuable to include a section on the impact of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality, on consumer behavior. Exploring how these technologies influence the way consumers perceive, interact with, and make decisions about products and services would provide insights into the evolving landscape of consumer behavior. Topics could include the role of AI in personalization, the influence of virtual experiences on purchasing decisions, and the ethical considerations surrounding technology–driven consumer interactions. Integrating these discussions would enhance the course's relevance in the context of rapidly advancing technological trends",

Fall 2023,382,0190,Consumer Behavior,online,unsigned,additional_topics,It would be helpful for quiz grades and assignment grades to be put in throughout the course of the semester. As this is an online class and it is challenging to know if I am doing well in the class without a grade to reflect that. Most of the lecture videos are old as you can see that on YouTube. It feels as though the professor isn’t using current/relevant information.,
Fall 2023,382,0190,Consumer Behavior,online,unsigned,additional_comments,"I really liked the two books, they were more challenging the most textbooks, but not nearly as dry and having that as focus in class was a really cool different then most of my other business classes I’ve taken in the past! Really wish more classes would take this approach with teaching",
Fall 2025,3378,0190,Marketing Research,online,signed,additional_comments,"This class should have never been remote... There was no teaching of basic knowledge of how to actually write R code. I think the class should have had a huge learning of the basics first and foremost. This was the most challenging part of the class, which only sets students up for failure. Yes, the videos discussed different punctuations, but it simply wasn't enough. Taking the first exam was like being thrown into the deep end without learning to swim. I ended up spending an entire week learning from YouTube and other resources to learn how to do it myself. This should have been built into the course.",
Fall 2025,3378,0190,Marketing Research,online,unsigned,most_value,"I think that teaching through a screen is a very challenging concept, and despite that, Erin has been able to make me feel as if I was actually seeing her every week. Not only that, but she was able to share with me her joy and interest for the concepts we were learning, and that made me willing to discover things with her every week. I loved how the exercise were presented to us and how the work load was given.",

Fall 2025,3378,0190,Marketing Research,online,unsigned,additional_comments,"Really hard to follow what we were supposed to do, and the pacing made it even more confusing. Sometimes I didn’t have to look at the material for two weeks because there were no assignments, and then suddenly we were expected to remember everything and every little detail of a coding class. The long gaps without practice made it difficult to stay engaged or retain what we learned, and the expectations weren’t always clear when new tasks finally came up. More consistent assignments or checkpoints would have helped a lot with keeping up and understanding the material.",
Fall 2025,3378,0190,Marketing Research,online,unsigned,additional_comments,"This was genuinely one of the worst courses I have ever taken. Was expected to know how to learn extensive code without directions. The content videos were no help, and she ""taught"" by providing vague examples in a written document. Did not grade anything for over two months. Took her over a month to grade an exam worth 20% of our grade. Does not answer her emails at all. She should be providing lecture videos that explain how to actually write the code, not on a written document. She also has gotten extremely lazy and would not post our homework for the week until Thursday or Friday, and it would be due on Sunday. Did not post assignments for three weeks, and is clearly in over her head. She needs to make some decisions about what her priorities are because this class clearly is not one of them.",
Fall 2025,382,0001,Consumer Behavior,in-person,signed,most_value,Every lecture was the most valuable to me. Professor Carter did a great job explaining concepts and often showed short videos that helped our understanding and kept us engaged.,

Fall 2025,382,0001,Consumer Behavior,in-person,unsigned,most_value,The hackathons were very helpful attaching the material we had learned to real life situations. I enjoyed working in groups to do this as well to get multiple opinions.,
Fall 2025,382,0001,Consumer Behavior,in-person,unsigned,most_value,I think the Hackathons are really valuable because they really get your whole group thinking and working together sharing ideas probably more than any other activity in the class.,
Fall 2025,382,0001,Consumer Behavior,in-person,unsigned,most_value,I thought that the discussion nature of the lectures was really valuable to understanding the material.,

Fall 2025,382,0001,Consumer Behavior,in-person,unsigned,additional_topics,"I really like how this class was setup personally, there isn't really a need for a long paper in this class but I would maybe say a longer, drawn out group project? I still think the Hackathons are great for group work.",
