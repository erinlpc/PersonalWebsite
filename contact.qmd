## For Students

Current students: reach out via email or Brightspace. Office hours are posted each semester and announced in class.

I'm always happy to talk about research opportunities, career questions, or course material you're wrestling with.

## For Collaboration

I occasionally take on consulting projects focused on behavioral research to inform marketing strategy and brand development. I'm most interested in projects that:

- Have potential for academic publication
- Focus on sustainable agriculture, food systems, or Maine-based organizations
- Involve interesting behavioral questions

If your project isn't a fit for me, I'm glad to refer you to someone who might be better suited.

## Media & Speaking

For media inquiries or speaking requests, email me with details about your project or event. I'm particularly happy to discuss consumer psychology, sustainable agriculture, or the intersection of the two.
