The **BARD Institute** is an independent organization I co-founded and co-direct. We work to strengthen sustainable agriculture by bringing contemporary business thinking and research to small-scale producers.

This work was inspired by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson's [Climate Venn Diagram](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/xjh53gn)—finding the intersection of what you're good at, what the world needs, and what brings you joy. For me, that intersection sits squarely at the junction of behavioral science, business strategy, and sustainable food systems.
